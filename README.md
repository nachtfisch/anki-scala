# anki-scala

SRS app to learn new words by means of a spaced repetition algorithm. The algorithm was more or less ported over from 
anki. The front end is a simple web app.

Project is entirely written in scala and acts as a playground for an isomorphic application. 

Backend is written using normal scala, frontend with scala.js. No Persistence is implemented, so entire application
state will be lost after restart.
